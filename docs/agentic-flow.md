# AI-Assisted Product Development Flow

This document outlines a repeatable process for using AI to create a comprehensive product development workflow - from initial PRD to MVP implementation to final documentation.

## Overview

The process consists of five main stages:

1. **Create Functional PRD** - Generate a user-focused, non-technical PRD
2. **Generate MVP with bolt.new** - Use the functional PRD to create a working prototype
3. **Analyze Implementation** - Have AI analyze the generated codebase
4. **Create Comprehensive PRD** - Combine functional requirements with technical implementation details
5. **Set Up Documentation Structure** - Create an AI-optimized documentation system

## Detailed Process

### Stage 1: Create Functional PRD

#### Step 1.1: Generate Non-Technical PRD

**Prompt:**
```
I need to create a non-technical, functionality-focused PRD for a project called [PROJECT_NAME]. The PRD should:

1. Focus entirely on user benefits and features rather than technical implementation
2. Use simple, accessible language without technical jargon
3. Organize information from a user's perspective
4. Include user personas and real-world use cases

Please include the following sections:
- Executive Summary
- Product Overview with problem/solution/benefit matrix
- User Benefits
- Key Features with priority levels (MVP vs. future)
- User Experience flows
- Data Privacy considerations
- Target Users
- Implementation Timeline

[PROVIDE BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PROJECT IDEA]
```

#### Step 1.2: Refine the PRD

Review the generated PRD and ask for specific improvements:

**Prompt:**
```
Please enhance this PRD with:
1. More detailed user personas
2. A feature priority table showing MVP vs. future features
3. Success metrics for evaluating the product
4. Real-world use cases showing how different users would interact with the product
```

### Stage 2: Generate MVP with bolt.new

#### Step 2.1: Create bolt.new Prompt

**Prompt:**
```
I need to create a prompt for bolt.new to generate an initial implementation of [PROJECT_NAME]. The prompt should:

1. Focus on functionality rather than specific technologies
2. Describe core features without prescribing implementation details
3. Outline user flows and data structure concepts
4. Provide visual design direction and privacy considerations

Please create this prompt based on the functional PRD I've developed.
```

#### Step 2.2: Use bolt.new to Generate MVP

1. Go to https://bolt.new
2. Paste the generated prompt
3. Follow bolt.new's guidance to generate the MVP
4. Download the generated codebase

### Stage 3: Analyze Implementation

#### Step 3.1: Have AI Analyze the Codebase

**Prompt:**
```
I've downloaded the MVP implementation of [PROJECT_NAME] generated by bolt.new. Please help me analyze the codebase to understand:

1. The overall architecture and technology stack
2. Key components and their relationships
3. Data models and database schema
4. Authentication and security implementation
5. Frontend structure and UI components

I'll share key files with you to examine. Let's start with:
- Project structure overview
- Main configuration files
- Database schema/migrations
- Core components
```

#### Step 3.2: Identify Implementation Details

**Prompt:**
```
Based on your analysis of the codebase, please identify:

1. Non-functional characteristics (performance, security, reliability)
2. Technical constraints and limitations
3. Implementation patterns and best practices used
4. Areas that might need improvement or optimization
5. Technical requirements for deployment and maintenance
```

### Stage 4: Create Comprehensive PRD

#### Step 4.1: Combine Functional and Technical Details

**Prompt:**
```
I now have:
1. A functional PRD focusing on user features and benefits
2. A working MVP implementation with technical details

Please create a comprehensive PRD that combines both aspects into a single document. The PRD should:

1. Maintain the user-focused sections from the functional PRD
2. Add technical specifications based on the actual implementation
3. Include non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
4. Provide implementation guidelines for developers
5. Document the development workflow and deployment process

The document should be non-redundant but comprehensive, serving as a single source of truth for the project.
```

#### Step 4.2: Clean Up Documentation

**Prompt:**
```
Now that we have a comprehensive PRD, please advise on which other documentation files are redundant and can be removed, and which should be kept as separate documents.
```

### Stage 5: Set Up Documentation Structure

#### Step 5.1: Create AI-Optimized Documentation Structure

**Prompt:**
```
I have a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a project called [PROJECT_NAME]. I need you to set up a streamlined documentation structure optimized for AI-assisted development that maximizes context retention between sessions while minimizing documentation overhead.

Please create the following documentation structure:

1. Create a /docs/sessions/ directory with a README.md explaining the session log format
2. Create an initial session log in /docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-initial-project-setup.md
3. Create /docs/architecture-decisions.md to track key technical decisions
4. Create /docs/active-issues.md for lightweight issue tracking
5. Create /docs/session-workflow.md with:
   - A session start prompt template that automatically reads context from previous sessions
   - A session end prompt template that automatically generates documentation and context
   - Initial context for the first development session
   - Initial focus and goals based on the PRD
6. Create /docs/README.md explaining the documentation structure and workflow

The documentation should follow these principles:
- Progressive context building (each session builds on previous ones)
- Single source of truth (avoid duplicate information)
- Embedded status updates (track progress within session logs)
- Just-in-time documentation (document decisions when made)

Most importantly, implement a fully automatic self-updating context bridge where:
1. The AI automatically reads context from docs/sessions/next-session-context.md at the start of each session
2. At the end of each session, the AI automatically generates a new context summary in next-session-context.md
3. No manual copying, pasting, or context transfer is needed by the user
4. The user only needs to provide optional additional information for each session

The session logs should capture:
- Context from the previous session
- Goals for the current session
- Technical decisions made with rationale
- Implementation details
- Next steps for the following session
- Updated milestone progress
```

## Example Workflow

Here's a concrete example of how to apply this process:

1. **Create Functional PRD**:
   - Describe a Twitter bookmark manager that helps users organize and analyze their Twitter bookmarks
   - Focus on user benefits: never lose content, find anything instantly, automatic organization
   - Define user personas: researchers, content creators, information collectors

2. **Generate MVP with bolt.new**:
   - Create a prompt describing core features without specifying technologies
   - Generate a React/Supabase implementation with bolt.new
   - Download the codebase

3. **Analyze Implementation**:
   - Examine database schema in Supabase migrations
   - Review React components and state management
   - Identify authentication flow and security measures

4. **Create Comprehensive PRD**:
   - Combine user features with technical implementation details
   - Document database schema, component architecture, and API design
   - Include non-functional requirements and implementation guidelines
   - Remove redundant documentation files

5. **Set Up Documentation Structure**:
   - Create session logs structure for ongoing development
   - Set up architecture decisions document
   - Implement automatic self-updating context bridge for AI sessions
   - Create session workflow templates that reference specific files rather than requiring copying/pasting

## Automatic Context Bridging for AI-Assisted Development

The key innovation in this workflow is the automatic context bridging system:

1. **File-Based Context**: Context is stored in a specific file (docs/sessions/next-session-context.md) that the AI automatically reads
2. **Zero-Copy Workflow**: Users never need to copy/paste context between sessions
3. **Minimal User Input**: Users only need to provide optional additional information for each session
4. **Automatic Documentation**: Session logs and context summaries are automatically generated by the AI
5. **Progressive Knowledge**: Context evolves naturally across sessions, building a continuous chain of development knowledge

To start a new development session:
```
I'm continuing development on the [PROJECT_NAME] project. Please read the context from our previous session in docs/sessions/next-session-context.md and help me with the following:

## Optional Additional Information
- Current Focus: [Optional: specific tasks or goals for this session]
- Questions/Challenges: [Optional: specific questions or challenges to address]

Please help me with implementing these features, addressing these challenges, and making progress on the project.
```

To end a development session:
```
We're wrapping up this development session. Please:

1. Summarize what we accomplished
2. Update the session log with technical decisions, implementation details, challenges, next steps, and milestone progress
3. Create a context summary for the next session

Please format this as a complete session log entry and provide the context summary separately.
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific but technology-agnostic** in your functional PRD - describe what the product should do, not how it should be built

2. **Let bolt.new guide technology choices** rather than prescribing specific frameworks or libraries

3. **Thoroughly examine the generated codebase** to understand implementation details before creating the comprehensive PRD

4. **Maintain separation between functional and technical aspects** in the comprehensive PRD to keep it accessible to different stakeholders

5. **Use AI to identify patterns and best practices** in the generated code that might not be immediately obvious

6. **Create automatic context bridging** for ongoing AI-assisted development that requires minimal user intervention

## Conclusion

This AI-assisted product development flow enables rapid iteration from concept to implementation while maintaining comprehensive documentation. By leveraging AI at each stage and implementing automatic context bridging, you can accelerate development while ensuring alignment between user needs and technical implementation.
