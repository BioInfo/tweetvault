# AI-Assisted Development Session Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for AI-assisted development sessions on the TweetVault project. It provides templates for starting and ending sessions, as well as maintaining context between sessions.

## Session Workflow Overview

1. **Session Start**: Use the session start template to begin a new development session
2. **Development Work**: Collaborate with the AI on implementation tasks
3. **Session End**: Use the session end template to trigger the AI to capture progress and update context
4. **Documentation**: The AI automatically generates the session log and context for the next session

## Session Start Template

```markdown
I'm continuing development on the TweetVault project. Please read the context from our previous session in docs/sessions/next-session-context.md and help me with the following:

## Optional Additional Information
- Current Focus: [Optional: specific tasks or goals for this session]
- Questions/Challenges: [Optional: specific questions or challenges to address]

Please help me with implementing these features, addressing these challenges, and making progress on the project. Let's start by discussing the approach for today's session.
```

## Session End Template

```markdown
We're wrapping up this development session. Please:

1. Summarize what we accomplished in this session
2. Update the session log with:
   - Technical decisions made and their rationale
   - Implementation details
   - Challenges encountered and solutions
   - Next steps for the following session
   - Updated milestone progress

3. Create a context summary for the next session that includes:
   - Key information about what we've built
   - Current state of the project
   - Important decisions and their implications
   - Outstanding issues and next priorities

Please format this as a complete session log entry and provide the context summary separately.
```

When you use this template, the AI will automatically:
1. Generate a new session log file (YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md) with all the requested information
2. Create a next-session-context.md file with the context summary for your next session
3. You don't need to manually create or edit these files - the AI handles this automatically

## Self-Updating Context Bridge

The key to maintaining continuity between development sessions is the self-updating context bridge:

1. **Automatic Context Reading**: At the start of each session, the AI automatically reads the context from docs/sessions/next-session-context.md
2. **Automatic Context Generation**: At the end of each session, the AI automatically generates a new context summary in next-session-context.md
3. **Zero Manual Transfer**: No copying, pasting, or manual context transfer is needed
4. **Continuous Knowledge Chain**: Context evolves with each session, building a continuous chain of development knowledge

This approach ensures that:
- No manual context transfer is needed
- Context is progressively built and refined
- The most relevant information is preserved
- The AI has sufficient context to provide effective assistance
- Documentation is created automatically as a byproduct of development

## Initial Context for First Development Session

The initial context is already available in docs/sessions/next-session-context.md. The AI will automatically read this file at the start of the first development session.

## Initial Focus and Goals

Based on the PRD, the initial focus for development should be:

### Authentication and User Management
- Implement Supabase Auth integration
- Create login and signup forms
- Set up protected routes
- Implement user settings storage

### Core UI Framework
- Create responsive layout components
- Implement navigation structure
- Set up routing
- Create base component library

### Data Management
- Implement database access patterns
- Create data models and type definitions
- Set up Supabase client and queries
- Implement error handling and loading states

### Twitter Data Import
- Create file upload and parsing functionality
- Implement data transformation and storage
- Handle duplicate detection
- Create import progress UI

## Session Documentation Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**: Focus on capturing essential information, not exhaustive details
2. **Prioritize Decisions**: Document the "why" behind technical decisions
3. **Link to Resources**: Reference external resources rather than duplicating information
4. **Focus on Context**: Emphasize information that will be valuable for future sessions
5. **Track Progress**: Update milestone progress to maintain visibility on overall project status
