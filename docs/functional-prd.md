## Real-World Use Cases

### Content Creator: Sarah
Sarah saves dozens of tweets weekly for content inspiration. Previously, she'd lose track of great ideas. Now with Twisdom, she categorizes bookmarks by theme and quickly finds relevant content when creating new work.

### Researcher: Michael
Michael uses Twitter to follow the latest developments in his field. With Twisdom's AI summaries, he can quickly review the main points of long threads without reading each tweet, and the insights dashboard helps him identify emerging trends.

### Information Collector: Alex
Alex bookmarks interesting articles and resources but rarely revisited them. Twisdom's reading queue reminds them of unread content, and the search feature helps them find specific information when needed for work or personal projects.

## Success Metrics

Success for Twisdom will be measured by how effectively it helps users organize and leverage their Twitter bookmarks. Key indicators include the percentage of imported bookmarks that are later accessed through search or filtering, the frequency of using AI-generated summaries, and user satisfaction with the organization system.
