# Authentication and Routing Implementation

## Session Summary
In this session, we implemented the authentication flow with Supabase and set up React Router with protected routes. We also enhanced the layout components to work with the router. This addresses [ISSUE-001], [ISSUE-002], and [ISSUE-003] from our active issues list.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Flow
- The authentication flow was already partially implemented with:
  - Supabase client setup in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
  - Authentication context and functions in `src/lib/auth.tsx`
  - Basic login/signup form in `src/components/AuthForm.tsx`

- We enhanced the authentication flow by:
  - Adding support for initializing the AuthForm in signup mode
  - Implementing protected routes to restrict access to authenticated users
  - Setting up proper redirection for unauthenticated users
  - Ensuring authentication state is properly managed throughout the application

### 2. Routing Implementation
- Installed React Router DOM: `npm install react-router-dom`
- Created a router configuration in `src/lib/router.tsx` with:
  - Protected routes for authenticated content
  - Public routes for authentication pages
  - Redirection logic for authentication state changes
- Updated the main application entry point to use the router
- Modified the Layout component to use React Router navigation
- Updated the App component to work with route-based navigation

### 3. Protected Routes
- Implemented a `ProtectedRoute` component that:
  - Checks if the user is authenticated
  - Shows a loading spinner while checking authentication
  - Redirects to the login page if not authenticated
  - Renders the protected content if authenticated
- Set up protected routes for:
  - Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Search (/search)
  - Collections (/collections)
  - Insights (/insights)
  - OAuth callback (/auth/callback)

### 4. Authentication Routes
- Implemented an `AuthRoute` component that:
  - Redirects to the dashboard if already logged in
  - Shows the authentication forms if not logged in
- Set up authentication routes for:
  - Login
  - Signup
  - OAuth callback
  
### 5. Settings Context Foundation
- Created a settings context provider file (`src/lib/settings-context.tsx`) as a starting point for the next session
- Verified that the user_settings table is already defined in the Supabase migrations
- Confirmed that the settings.ts file has functions for getting and updating user settings
- Reviewed the UserSettingsModal component that's already implemented with UI for changing settings

## Technical Decisions

### Router Structure
We chose to use a centralized router configuration in `src/lib/router.tsx` to keep all routing logic in one place. This makes it easier to manage and update routes as the application grows. Key decisions included:

1. **Nested Routes Pattern**: We used React Router's nested routes feature to organize routes logically and apply common layouts and authentication checks.

2. **Route Protection Strategy**: We implemented route protection using wrapper components rather than higher-order components or hooks. This approach provides clearer separation of concerns and makes the routing configuration more declarative.

3. **Redirect Handling**: We implemented redirects for unauthenticated users that preserve the original destination, allowing users to be sent to their intended page after logging in.

### Authentication Flow
We leveraged Supabase's authentication system for several reasons:

- Email/password authentication
- OAuth authentication with Google
- Session management
- Token refresh
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Built-in security features like rate limiting and protection against common attacks

This approach allowed us to implement a robust authentication system without building everything from scratch, while still maintaining flexibility for customization.

### Layout Component Updates
We modified the Layout component to work with React Router by:

1. **Removing State-Based Navigation**: We replaced the state-based navigation with React Router's Link components, which provides better URL-based navigation and browser history integration.

2. **Route-Based Active State**: We determined the active navigation item based on the current route path rather than a state variable, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the URL.

3. **Decoupling from App Component**: We removed the dependency on props passed from the App component, making the Layout component more independent and reusable.

## Implementation Details

### Protected Routes Implementation

```tsx
// Protected route wrapper component
const ProtectedRoute = () => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  const location = useLocation();

  // Show loading spinner while checking authentication
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  // Redirect to login if not authenticated
  if (!user) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: location }} replace />;
  }

  // Render the protected content
  return <Outlet />;
};
```

This component checks the authentication state and either shows a loading spinner, redirects to the login page, or renders the protected content using React Router's Outlet component.

### Router Configuration

```tsx
export const routes: RouteObject[] = [
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />,
  },
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <AuthRoute />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'login',
        element: <AuthForm />,
      },
      {
        path: 'signup',
        element: <AuthForm isSignUp />,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <ProtectedRoute />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'dashboard',
        element: <App view='dashboard' />,
      },
      // Other protected routes...
    ],
  },
];
```

This configuration defines the route structure with protected and public routes, using nested routes to apply common layouts and authentication checks.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: TypeScript Errors with Component Props

When updating the components to work with React Router, we encountered TypeScript errors related to component props. The errors occurred because we were passing props to components that didn't have those props defined in their interfaces.

**Solution**: We updated the component interfaces to accept the new props:

1. Updated the AuthForm component to accept an optional isSignUp prop
2. Updated the App component to accept an optional view prop
3. Modified the Layout component to derive the active view from the current route path

### Challenge 2: State Management with Router Integration

Integrating the router with the existing state-based navigation system required careful coordination to ensure the UI stayed in sync with the URL and vice versa.

**Solution**: We refactored the components to use route-based state determination:

1. Modified the Layout component to determine the active view from the current route path
2. Updated the App component to render content based on the view prop passed from the router
3. Ensured that navigation actions updated the URL rather than just changing state

### Protected Routes
We implemented protected routes using React Router's nested routes feature, which allows us to:
- Apply authentication checks at the route level
- Share layout components across protected routes
- Handle redirects and authentication state changes consistently

## Milestone Progress

   - Integrate the settings context provider with the main application
   - Connect the UserSettingsModal component to the settings context
   - Implement theme switching based on user preferences

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Ensure the user_settings table is properly set up in Supabase
   - Implement functions to store and retrieve user settings
   - Handle default settings for new users

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add feedback for settings changes
   - Implement real-time settings updates
   - Ensure settings persist across sessions

4. **Additional Authentication Features**:
   - Add password reset functionality
