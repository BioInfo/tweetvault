# Context Summary for Next Session

## Project State
TweetVault is an AI-powered Twitter bookmark manager in the initial setup phase. The project structure, documentation framework, and development environment are now in place. The application will be built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## Documentation Structure
A comprehensive documentation structure has been established with:
- Session logs for tracking development progress
- Architecture decision records for technical decisions
- Active issues tracking for task management
- Session workflow templates for AI-assisted development
- A self-updating context bridge for session continuity

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Build Tool**: Using Vite for better performance and developer experience
2. **State Management**: Using React Context for simplicity and sufficient functionality
3. **Backend**: Using Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
4. **Database Schema**: Implementing a normalized schema for better data integrity and query flexibility
5. **Documentation**: Using a session-based approach with progressive context building

## Current Priorities
1. **Authentication Flow**: Implement user authentication with Supabase Auth
2. **Layout Components**: Create the basic UI structure and navigation
3. **Routing**: Set up React Router with protected routes
4. **User Settings**: Implement storage and retrieval of user preferences

## Active Issues
- [ISSUE-001] Implement Authentication Flow (High Priority)
- [ISSUE-002] Create Basic Layout Components (High Priority)
- [ISSUE-003] Set Up Routing with React Router (High Priority)
- [ISSUE-004] Implement User Settings Storage (Medium Priority)

## Development Approach
The project follows an incremental development approach with:
- Feature-by-feature implementation
- Documentation of decisions and progress in session logs
- Regular updates to active issues and architecture decisions
- AI-assisted development using the established session workflow

## Next Development Session Focus
The next session should focus on implementing the authentication flow with Supabase, including:
- Setting up the Supabase client
- Creating login and signup forms
- Implementing authentication state management
- Setting up protected routes

This will address [ISSUE-001] and lay the foundation for user-specific features.
