# Context Summary for Next Session

## Project State

TweetVault is an AI-powered Twitter bookmark manager that has progressed from initial setup to having functional authentication, routing, user settings, and tweet collection capabilities. The project now has:

1. **Authentication System**: Complete Supabase authentication with email/password and Google OAuth
2. **Routing Structure**: React Router implementation with protected routes and public routes
3. **UI Components**: Layout components, navigation, tweet cards, and collection management
4. **State Management**: Authentication and settings state management with React Context
5. **Database Structure**: Schema with tables for tweets, collections, and user settings
6. **User Settings**: Complete settings management with theme switching and preferences
7. **Theme System**: Dark/light theme implementation with system preference detection
8. **Tweet Collection**: Import system for Twitter data exports and collection management

## Documentation Structure

A comprehensive documentation structure has been established with:
- Session logs for tracking development progress
- Architecture decision records for technical decisions
- Active issues tracking for task management
- Session workflow templates for AI-assisted development
- A self-updating context bridge for session continuity

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Build Tool**: Using Vite for better performance and developer experience
2. **State Management**: Using React Context for simplicity and sufficient functionality
3. **Backend**: Using Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
4. **Database Schema**: Implementing a normalized schema for better data integrity
5. **Documentation**: Using a session-based approach with progressive context building
6. **Authentication**: Using Supabase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth
7. **Routing**: Using React Router with protected routes for authenticated content
8. **Component Structure**: Using a modular component approach with clear separation of concerns
9. **Theme Implementation**: Using Tailwind's dark mode with class strategy and React context
10. **Tweet Import**: Using client-side parsing of Twitter data exports instead of API integration

### Decision Implications

- **React Context vs Redux**: Using React Context for state management keeps the application simpler and more maintainable for our current needs. As the application grows, we may need to reevaluate this decision if state management becomes more complex.

- **Supabase Backend**: Using Supabase provides a comprehensive backend solution with minimal setup. This allows us to focus on frontend development while still having robust backend capabilities.

- **Protected Routes Implementation**: Our approach to protected routes using wrapper components provides a clear separation of concerns and makes the routing configuration more declarative.

- **Component Co-location**: We've organized related files together, which improves maintainability and makes it easier to understand the codebase.

- **Tweet Import Approach**: By focusing on importing data from exports rather than using the Twitter API, we've created a more privacy-focused solution that doesn't require API keys or external dependencies.

## Current Priorities

1. **Complete Tweet Collection**: Finish implementing AI-powered tagging and summarization
2. **Search and Filtering**: Enhance the search functionality with advanced filters
3. **UI Improvements**: Add animations and drag-and-drop functionality
4. **Data Synchronization**: Implement real-time updates and offline support

## Active Issues

- [ISSUE-005] Implement Tweet Collection Functionality (In Progress)

## Resolved Issues

- [ISSUE-001] Implement Authentication Flow
- [ISSUE-002] Create Basic Layout Components
- [ISSUE-003] Set Up Routing with React Router
- [ISSUE-004] Implement User Settings Storage

## Development Approach

The project follows an incremental development approach with:
- Feature-by-feature implementation
- Documentation of decisions and progress in session logs
- Regular updates to active issues and architecture decisions
- AI-assisted development using the established session workflow

## Next Development Session Focus

The next session should focus on completing the tweet collection functionality, including:

1. **AI Features**:
   - Implement automatic tagging of tweets
   - Create summarization functionality
   - Implement topic extraction
   - Add sentiment analysis

2. **Advanced Search and Filtering**:
   - Implement full-text search
   - Add advanced filtering options
   - Create saved searches functionality
   - Add sorting options

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add animations for smoother transitions
   - Implement drag-and-drop for organizing collections
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices

4. **Data Management**:
   - Implement batch operations for multiple tweets
   - Add export functionality for collections
   - Implement data backup and restore
   - Add sharing capabilities for collections

This will complete [ISSUE-005] and provide the foundation for the next phase of development.

## Technical Context for Tweet Collection Implementation

### Current Implementation

The tweet collection functionality currently includes:

1. **Tweet Import System**:
   - Parsers for different export formats (JSON, CSV, markdown)
   - Secure import flow with privacy controls
   - User interface for importing and previewing tweets

2. **Tweet Storage**:
   - Functions for saving tweets to the database
   - Collection management functionality
   - Search and filtering capabilities

3. **UI Components**:
   - TweetCard component for displaying individual tweets
   - TweetList component with filtering and sorting
   - TweetImporter modal for importing tweets

### Required Enhancements

1. **AI Processing**:
   - Implement a text classification service for tagging tweets
   - Create a summarization service for generating tweet summaries
   - Implement topic extraction for identifying key topics
   - Add sentiment analysis for determining tweet sentiment

2. **Search Improvements**:
   - Implement full-text search with relevance ranking
   - Add advanced filtering options (date ranges, engagement metrics, etc.)
   - Create saved searches functionality
   - Add sorting options (date, popularity, relevance)

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add animations for smoother transitions
   - Implement drag-and-drop for organizing collections
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices

## Code References

### Tweet Import System

The tweet import system is implemented in:
- `src/lib/tweet-parser.ts`: Parsers for different export formats
- `src/components/TweetImporter.tsx`: UI for importing tweets

### Tweet Storage

The tweet storage functionality is implemented in:
- `src/lib/tweets.ts`: Functions for saving and retrieving tweets

### UI Components

The UI components for tweet collection are implemented in:
- `src/components/TweetCard.tsx`: Component for displaying individual tweets
- `src/components/TweetList.tsx`: Component for displaying a list of tweets with filtering and sorting

## Outstanding Issues and Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: For users with large collections, we need to implement pagination and virtualization to maintain performance.

2. **Offline Support**: Consider implementing offline support for viewing saved tweets when the user is not connected to the internet.

3. **Data Synchronization**: If the user is logged in on multiple devices, we should consider how to handle data synchronization.

4. **AI Processing Costs**: AI features like summarization and topic extraction may have associated costs. We should implement them efficiently to minimize costs.

5. **Privacy Considerations**: We need to ensure that sensitive information is properly handled and that users have control over their data.
