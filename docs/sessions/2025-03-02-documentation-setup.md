# Session: 2025-03-02-documentation-setup

## Previous Context
*This is the first documentation-focused session, so there is no previous context.*

## Session Goals
- Set up a streamlined documentation structure optimized for AI-assisted development
- Create a self-updating context bridge for session continuity
- Establish templates for session start and end
- Implement lightweight issue tracking
- Document architecture decisions

## Technical Decisions

### Documentation Structure Decision
- **Decision**: Implement a session-based documentation approach with progressive context building
- **Rationale**: This approach maximizes context retention between sessions while minimizing documentation overhead, making AI-assisted development more effective

### Context Bridge Implementation Decision
- **Decision**: Create a self-updating context bridge in the session workflow document
- **Rationale**: This eliminates the need for manual context transfer or shell scripts, making the workflow more seamless and reducing friction

### Issue Tracking Decision
- **Decision**: Use a lightweight Markdown-based issue tracking system instead of an external tool
- **Rationale**: Keeps all project information in a single repository, making it easier to maintain context and reducing tool switching overhead

### Architecture Decision Record Format Decision
- **Decision**: Implement a comprehensive ADR format that includes context, alternatives, rationale, and consequences
- **Rationale**: This format ensures that not just decisions but their context and implications are preserved, which is crucial for long-term project understanding

## Implementation Details

### Documentation Directory Structure
Created the following structure:
```
docs/
├── README.md                         # Documentation overview
├── active-issues.md                  # Lightweight issue tracking
├── architecture-decisions.md         # Technical decision records
├── session-workflow.md               # Session templates and workflow
└── sessions/                         # Session logs directory
    ├── README.md                     # Session log format guide
    └── 2025-03-02-initial-project-setup.md  # Initial session log
```

### Session Log Format
Implemented a structured format for session logs that includes:
- Context from previous sessions
- Session goals
- Technical decisions with rationale
- Implementation details
- Challenges and solutions
- Next steps
- Milestone progress updates

### Self-Updating Context Bridge
Created a workflow where:
1. The AI reads context from the previous session at the start
2. Development work proceeds with this context in mind
3. At the end of the session, the AI updates the context for the next session
4. This creates a continuous chain of context without manual intervention

### Issue Tracking System
Implemented a lightweight issue tracking system in `active-issues.md` with:
- Unique issue identifiers
- Type, status, and priority fields
- Detailed descriptions
- Acceptance criteria
- Links to related session logs

### Architecture Decision Records
Created a system for documenting architecture decisions with:
- Decision identifiers and titles
- Status tracking
- Context description
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale for the decision
- Consequences and implications
- Related decisions

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing Detail and Brevity
**Problem**: Documentation needs to be detailed enough to be useful but concise enough to be maintainable.

**Solution**: Implemented a progressive context approach where:
- Core information is maintained in dedicated files (architecture decisions, issues)
- Session-specific details are captured in session logs
- Context is distilled and refined between sessions
- Templates ensure consistency without requiring excessive detail

### Challenge: Ensuring Context Continuity
**Problem**: Ensuring that context flows naturally between sessions without manual intervention.

**Solution**: Created a self-updating context bridge where:
- The session end template prompts for context creation
- The session start template includes a place for this context
- The context evolves with each session, building on previous knowledge
- The most relevant information is preserved while outdated details fade

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
