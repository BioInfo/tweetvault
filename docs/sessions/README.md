# Session Logs

## Overview

This directory contains session logs for the TweetVault project. Session logs are a key component of our AI-assisted development workflow, designed to maximize context retention between development sessions while minimizing documentation overhead.

## Purpose

Session logs serve multiple purposes:
1. **Knowledge Persistence**: Capture context, decisions, and progress across development sessions
2. **Onboarding**: Help new developers quickly understand the project's evolution
3. **Decision Tracking**: Document technical decisions and their rationale in context
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track development progress against milestones
5. **Context Building**: Provide AI assistants with necessary context for effective collaboration

## Session Log Format

Each session log follows a consistent format:

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title

## Previous Context
[Summary of relevant context from previous sessions]

## Session Goals
- [Specific goal 1]
- [Specific goal 2]
- ...

## Technical Decisions
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]
- ...

## Implementation Details
[Key implementation details, code snippets, and explanations]

## Challenges and Solutions
[Any challenges encountered and how they were addressed]

## Next Steps
- [Next step 1]
- [Next step 2]
- ...

## Updated Milestone Progress
- [Milestone 1]: [Status]
- [Milestone 2]: [Status]
- ...
```

## Naming Convention

Session logs follow this naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md
```

For example:
- `2025-03-02-initial-project-setup.md`
- `2025-03-05-auth-implementation.md`
- `2025-03-10-tweet-import-feature.md`

## Progressive Context Building

Session logs implement a progressive context building approach:
1. Each session begins by reviewing context from previous sessions
2. New context is added during the current session
3. At the end of each session, the context is updated for the next session
4. This creates a continuous chain of context that evolves with the project

## Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Focus on capturing essential information, not exhaustive details
2. **Prioritize Decisions**: Document the "why" behind technical decisions
3. **Link to Resources**: Reference external resources rather than duplicating information
4. **Update Regularly**: Create a new session log for each significant development session
5. **Focus on Context**: Emphasize information that will be valuable for future sessions
