## Decisions

### [ADR-001] - Use Vite as Build Tool

**Date**: 2025-03-02
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

#### Context
We needed to choose a build tool for the React application that would provide a good developer experience and optimal production builds.

#### Alternatives Considered
- Create React App (CRA)
- Next.js
- Vite

#### Decision
Use Vite as the build tool for the TweetVault application.

#### Rationale
- Vite offers significantly faster development server startup and hot module replacement
- Better TypeScript integration with esbuild
- More modern defaults and easier configuration
- Smaller bundle sizes in production
- Active development and community support

#### Consequences
- Developers will need to learn Vite-specific configuration
- Some CRA-specific libraries might require adaptation
- Improved development experience and build performance

### [ADR-002] - Use React Context for State Management

**Date**: 2025-03-02
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

#### Context
We needed to choose a state management solution for the application that would handle global state like authentication, user settings, and UI state.

#### Alternatives Considered
- Redux
- MobX
- Zustand
- React Context API

#### Decision
Use React Context API for state management.

#### Rationale
- The application's state requirements are relatively simple
- Context API is built into React and requires no additional dependencies
- Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux
- Easier learning curve for new developers
- Can be extended with useReducer for more complex state logic if needed

#### Consequences
- May need to reconsider if state management becomes more complex
- Need to be careful about context provider organization to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Simpler codebase with fewer dependencies

### [ADR-003] - Use Supabase for Backend Services

**Date**: 2025-03-02
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

#### Context
We needed a backend solution that would provide authentication, database, and storage capabilities without requiring a custom server implementation.

#### Alternatives Considered
- Firebase
- AWS Amplify
- Custom Express/Node.js backend
- Supabase

#### Decision
Use Supabase as the backend service provider.

#### Rationale
- PostgreSQL database with full SQL capabilities
- Built-in authentication with multiple providers
- Row-level security for data protection
- Real-time subscriptions
- Open-source and self-hostable if needed in the future
- Good TypeScript support

#### Consequences
- Dependency on Supabase as a service
- Need to work within Supabase's constraints and features
- Reduced backend development and maintenance overhead
- PostgreSQL offers more powerful query capabilities than NoSQL alternatives

### [ADR-004] - Implement Normalized Database Schema

**Date**: 2025-03-02
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

#### Context
We needed to design a database schema that would efficiently store and query tweet data, collections, and user settings.

#### Alternatives Considered
- Denormalized schema with redundant data
- Fully normalized relational schema
- Document-based approach with JSON columns

#### Decision
Implement a normalized database schema with separate tables for tweets, collections, and junction tables for many-to-many relationships.

#### Rationale
- Better data integrity with foreign key constraints
- More efficient storage by avoiding data duplication
- More flexible querying capabilities
- Better performance for complex queries
- Easier to maintain and extend

#### Consequences
- More complex queries for some operations
- Need for joins when retrieving related data
- Better scalability as the application grows
- More consistent data structure
